### üëã Hello there! I‚Äôm Halil Sen 

I'm a software engineer with a passion for mobile development. I specialize in developing native Android applications.

üì± You can check out my wordle game on the Google Play Store called [OxWordle!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kodlamayabasla.wordle_oxford) and its source code on my GitHub repository [OxWordle Repository](https://github.com/style96/oxwordle).

üíª I also enjoy working on personal projects, and you can find some of them on my personal website, [KodlamayaBasla](https://kodlamayabasla.com/), where I blog about my experiences as a developer and share some of my open-source projects and its source code on my Github repository [Website Theme Repository](https://github.com/style96/kodlamayabasla_childtheme)

üî® My toolset includes Java, Kotlin, and React Native. I'm also familiar with various mobile development frameworks and libraries such as Android Jetpack and Firebase. I have hands-on experiences about developing Linux based smart TV embedded systems so I wrote on C++ for middleware layer and React for the UI layer.

üë®‚Äçüíª When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking or playing video games. Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/halil-sen/) to chat about mobile development or just say hi!
